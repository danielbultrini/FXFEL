This is a post processing tool to process and plot the Standard Particle Distribution file used in 
the UKXFEL suite of programs, it consists of a series of modules that can be easily used to automatically 
plot the most common values and return arrays of the calculated and seperated values for your own 
analysis. 

Requires Bokeh for plotting, might add matplotlib alternative, but it is not as good for the large datasets we 
will envcounter. 

Dependencies: 
Numpy
pytables
Bokeh
SciPy
